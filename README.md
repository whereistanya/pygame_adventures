## moana.py 
moana.py is a small extremely stupid game I made to entertain my kid on a long train journey. It's in pygame because I wanted to learn pygame. I add features occasionally, usually with a four year old leaning on my arm saying things like "the crab should go up and down but not very fast".

Warning: it makes sounds.

I don't have rights to the moana pictures (obviously) and I forget where I found
the shell, so I should replace them. The mud picture is legit mine at least.

Sounds by Elizabeth :-D
