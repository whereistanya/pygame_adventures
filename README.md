## moana.py 
moana.py is a small extremely stupid game because I wanted to learn pygame.

Warning: it makes sounds.

I don't have rights to the moana pictures (obviously) and I forget where I found
the shell, so I should replace them. The mud picture is legit mine at least.

Sounds by Elizabeth :-D

## toddlerclock.py
toddlerclock.is a small extremely stupid colour-coded clock which also uses pygame.

It displays a message based on the time of day and tells Elizabeth whether she can
wake me. It's intended to be run on a raspberry pi with a pitft screen.
